## Introduction
The project was conceived to tackle the persistent issue of poor working conditions for low-skilled labourers, both locally and internationally. The tragic deaths of Indian workers in Qatar underscored the urgent need for safer working environments globally. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated livelihood challenges for these vulnerable groups, highlighting the importance of innovative solutions that can facilitate safer and more efficient working conditions.

## Purpose
The project aims to address the challenges faced by low-skilled labourers and customers by creating a platform that enhances accessibility, efficiency in job matching, and ensures safer working conditions through innovative technologies.




## Project Description

### Labourer Side (Flutter):
- **Text-to-Speech Module:**
  - Guides workers through the app, ensuring accessibility even for less educated users.
  
- **Documents Awareness:**
  - Provides comprehensive guidance through instructional videos and direct links to essential documents.
  - Educates about legal rights, government schemes, and safety protocols.
  
- **Job Search:**
  - Enables labourers to browse and apply for low-skill wage jobs directly from the app.
  
- **Legal AI Chatbot:**
  - Gemini-based chatbot with a simplified 4-button UI, designed for ease of use by less educated individuals.
  - Provides legal assistance, answering queries related to employment rights and legal protections.
  
- **Worker Location Storage:**
  - Utilizes Firebase to securely store worker locations collected during registration.
  - Enables accurate job matching based on proximity for efficient service delivery.

### Customer Side (Java):
- **Job Matching Algorithm:**
  - Algorithmically matches customer requests with the nearest suitable worker based on stored location data.
  - Ensures efficient and cost-effective service provision by prioritizing proximity.
  
- **Contact Information:**
  - Provides customers with direct access to worker contact details for seamless communication and task coordination.
  
- **Hiring Process:**
  - Streamlines the hiring process, allowing customers to select and hire labourers quickly for various tasks.
  
- **IoT-Based Safety Modules:**
  - Implements IoT sensors to monitor environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, and worker heart rate in real-time.
  - Alerts the customer-side system in case of emergencies or hazardous conditions, ensuring prompt intervention and worker safety.

### Database (Firebase):
- Acts as a centralized database facilitating communication between the labourer and customer sides.
- Stores crucial data including worker profiles, job preferences, and real-time updates on job status and worker availability.

This comprehensive setup ensures a seamless interaction between labourers and customers while prioritizing safety, efficiency, and accessibility. The integration of IoT-based safety modules further enhances worker security, demonstrating our commitment to improving working conditions and livelihoods for low-skilled labourers.
